## Quick Start

If you just want to get on your way, you can use on of the included preset projects as a starting point.

## License key

The license key is only used for registering the purchase and gaining access to the PQINA customer portal, it doesn't have to be used in the JavaScript package itself.

## Package

-   The _packages_ folder contains the library files suitable for various project types.
-   The _presets_ folder contains multiple example integrations with different JavaScript framework and file upload components.

The _packages_ folder contains the core _pintura_ folder which includes the Pintura Image Editor IIFE, UMD, and JavaScript Module builds as well as the stylesheet.

All other folders inside the _packages_ folder are for use with specific project types.

We strongly advise to use the _JavaScript Module_ build.

## Compatibility

-   Chrome

JavaScript module support statistics: https://caniuse.com/es6-module

### Safari 11 and 12

-   Safari 11 (global usage 0.05%)
-   Safari 12 (global usage 0.01%)

To add support for these browsers we need to polyfill Pointer Events.
Download polyfill here: https://github.com/Rich-Harris/Points

### Safari 10 and Edge 18

-   Safari 10 (global usage 0.01%)
-   Edge 18 (global usage 0.23%)

These browsers don't fully support JavaScript modules and will require polyfills to function correctly. To make Pintura Image Editor work on these browsers you'll need to load the IIFE version or transpile a compatible version yourself.

Required polyfills for Edge 18:

-   Symbol.asyncIterator
-   HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toBlob

Include this URL in your page to polyfill both the APIs above: https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Symbol.asyncIterator%2CHTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toBlob

### Internet Explorer 11

Internet Explorer 11 is currently not supported, global usage is at around 1.12%.

We're surveying customer requirements, please let use know if you require compatibility and why.

## JavaScript Module

This is the JavaScript module build of Pintura Image Editor. We can add this version to the page by setting the script `type` attribute to `"module"`.

If you're not familiar with JavaScript modules, please read this JavaScript modules introduction on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Introducing_an_example

The Pintura Image Editor module supports tree-shaking and will work perfectly with webpack, rollup.js, Parcel, or Snowpack.

We can load the JavaScript module version like this:

```html
<script type="module">
    import { openEditor } from './pintura/pintura.js';
    openEditor({
        /* editor options */
    });
</script>
```

**Please note that the JavaScript module version isn't minified.**

After importing the required submodules, compressing the result with a tool like Terser, and gzipping the package, the end result is around 100KB depending on which plugins you use.

## IIFE

This version adds a `pintura` variable to the global window namespace. Include in the page with a normal script tag. This version of Pintura Image Editor is minified.

```html
<script src="./pintura/pintura-iife.js"></script>
<script>
    pintura.openEditor({
        /* editor options */
    });
</script>
```

## UMD

This version is for use with RequireJS or other AMD module loaders. The UMD version of Pintura Image Editor is also minified.

```js
define('./pintura/pintura-umd', ([pintura]) => {
    pintura.openEditor({
        /* editor options */
    });
});
```
